# HealthWhere
HealthWhere decodes healthcare access in Canada, one map at a time, to empower data-driven decisions. We employed Gaussian Mixture Model using Scikit-learn  to cluster health regions based on their similarities in several aspects of healthcare assess. Once the resulted clusters were defined, these clusters were visualized on a fully interactive map using folium and geopandas.

HealthWhere was created in consultation with experts. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other accessible view of Canadian healthcare access exists. We aim to impact the landscape of healthcare access by addressing its issues, updating the outlook of healthcare access information. Policymakers can use HealthWhere to visualize healthcare disparities and make data-driven decisions. And on an individual level, our map promotes awareness about healthcare realities in Canada, allowing individuals to contact local policymakers about their concerns. Throughout our process, we value data transparency and interpretability. These values matter even more when healthcare data is involved. HealthWhereâ€™s focus is to combat this and increase overall transparency of healthcare information throughout Canada.

## Datasets

We curated data using the wait time for priority procedures, number of hospital beds staffed and in operation per population with perceived low health, and number of physicians per population datasets from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) and Statistics Canada. For our maps, we curated geospatial data using the health region geographic boundaries and open database of healthcare facilities from Statistics Canada.
