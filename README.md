# HealthWhere
HealthWhere decodes healthcare access in Canada, one map at a time, to empower data-driven decisions. We employed Gaussian Mixture Model using Scikit-learn  to cluster health regions based on their similarities in several aspects of healthcare assess. Once the resulted clusters were defined, these clusters were visualized on a fully interactive map using folium and geopandas.
